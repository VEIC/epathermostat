Files added
-----------
changelog.txt: (this file) For internal VEIC use
environment_epa_dev_new_test.yml: Conda env for VEIC use (running tests and using notebooks in Python 3)
environment_epa_dev_new_test_Py2.yml: Conda env for VEIC use (running tests and using notebooks in Python 2)
environment_epa_prod_new_test.yml: Conda env for VEIC use (manually testing thermostat module and running runtests.py in Python 3)
environment_epa_prod_new_test_Py2.yml: Conda env for VEIC use (manually testing thermostat module and running runtests.py in Python 2)
requirements.txt: Added this file in case want to create a prod env without the thermostat module also installed, as is done when installing using setup.py; Env created successfully from this file in Linux, but not Win10 (statsmodels build failed)

Files changed
-------------
dev-requirements.txt: Upgraded dev requirements as needed to work with updated prod env, added matplotlib since one notebook imports this
setup.py: Upgraded pandas and eemeter versions
docs/conf.py: Updated eemeter in MOCK_MODULES and added path to thermostat module; Sphinx docs were successfully generated from this file
thermostatreqnotes.txt: Updated with pip freeze of Linux setup.py env
thermostat/importers.py: No changes needed - all eemeter references unchanged
thermostat/parallel.py: Revised eemeter import - imported path and function name
thermostat/stats.py: Removed two imports from eemeter that are not used

Files not updated, but which will likely need update for package release

.travis.yml
runtests.py
tox.ini
travis_requirements.txt

Environments
------------
Env created successfully from setup.py in Linux, but not in Win10 (statsmodels build fails - although it does install with conda on Windows)

Automated Testing
-----------------
Win10:
All tests pass, Python 2&3, on both old and new envs
Old-env test of revised parallel.py passes because the old eemeter had the same function in it, in the same place, as new eemeter, but the former version of this file was pointing to its extra "root" version of the function instead
Linux:
In progress, FTP access to NOAA is currently blocked on dev machine
